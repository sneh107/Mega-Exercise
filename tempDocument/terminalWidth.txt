ioctl() stands for "input/output control" and is a system call in Unix-like operating systems. It's used to perform various control operations on devices and files.

In this specific case, ioctl() is being used to retrieve information about the terminal window. Here's a breakdown of the parameters:

STDOUT_FILENO: This is a file descriptor representing the standard output stream, typically set to 1. It's used here to specify the output device, which in this case is the terminal window.

TIOCGWINSZ: This is a macro defined in <sys/ioctl.h>. It stands for "Terminal Input/Output Control Get WINdow SiZe". It's used to request information about the terminal window's size.

&w: This is a pointer to a structure of type winsize. The winsize structure is defined in <sys/ioctl.h> and contains information about the terminal window's size, including the number of rows (ws_row) and columns (ws_col).

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    struct winsize w;
    ioctl(STDOUT_FILENO, TIOCGWINSZ, &w);

    int terminalWidth = w.ws_col;
    int terminalHeight = w.ws_row;

    printf("Terminal width: %d\n", terminalWidth);
    printf("Terminal height: %d\n", terminalHeight);

    return 0;
}

int terminalWidth = w.ws_col;

    char text[] = "Centered Text";
    int textWidth = strlen(text);

    int leftPadding = (terminalWidth - textWidth) / 2;

    // Print left padding
    for (int i = 0; i < leftPadding; i++) {
        printf(" ");
    }

    // Print the text
    printf("%s\n", text);
